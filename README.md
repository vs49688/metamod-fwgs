# Metamod-FWGS

Fork of Metamod, intended for use with Xash3D FWGS engine on many different architectures & platforms. Original [Metamod-R](https://github.com/rehlds/metamod-r) contains a lot of x86 JIT optimizations, memory patching hacks, constrained by binary compatibility with ReHLDS and legacy game libraries, and not flexible enough to be compatible with wide variety of compilers/toolchains and architectures.

## Documentation

Documentation is mostly similar with Metamod-R, so at this point we do not have any specific documentation for this project.
